## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global health crisis, projected to cause 39 million fatalities
between 2025-2050. Timely and accurate surveillance of AMR pathogens is essential for tracking their
resistance profiles and guiding interventions. However, many healthcare and public health professionals face
barriers in bioinformatics expertise and computational resources, limiting their ability to analyse pathogen
genomes effectively.

To bridge this gap, with mentoring from Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE),
we developed AMRColab, an open-access bioinformatics suite hosted on Google Colaboratory (Lam et al.
2024). Designed for ease of use, AMRColab enables users with minimal bioinformatics experience to detect
and visualise AMR determinants in pathogen genomes through an intuitive,â€˜ plug-and-play â€™approach. Our
platform integrates established tools such as AMRFinderPlus, ResFinder and hAMRonization, facilitating
comparative analysis and transmission trend visualisation of AMR pathogens.

Below are the list of different AMRColab Modules.
